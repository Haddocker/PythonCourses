age = input()

# 1 year = 52 weeks
# Average age 90 years


# MY CODE:
# total_age_in_weeks = 90 * 52
# weeks_lived = int(age) * 52

# weeks_left = total_age_in_weeks - weeks_lived

# print(f"You have {weeks_left} weeks left to live...")


# UDEMY CODE:
years = 90 - int(age)
weeks = years * 52

print(f"You have {weeks} left.")
