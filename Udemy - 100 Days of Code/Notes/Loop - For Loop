# For Loop with List:
for item in list_of_items:
    # Do something to each item

# Example:
fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]
for fruit in fruits:
    # The For Loop will loop through each of the items (fruit) and print them one by one.
    print(fruit)



# For Loop with the range() function:
for number in range(a, b):
    print(number)

# Example:
for number in range(1, 10):
    # The For Loop will print 1-9 because 0 counts as well.
    print(number)

# Increase a Range For Loop with a specific number:
for number in range(1, 11, 3):
    # The For Loop will print the range but in steps of three.
    print(number)
